## 🌐 The Problem We Solve

The ecological benefits framework offers a standardized way of quantifying and communicating ecological benefits for projects. However, discovering these projects and verifying their benefits remains a challenge.

EBFNT introduces a standard way to connect attestation networks of trust to projects that claim ecological benefits. This makes projects discoverable and their benefits verifiable through an intuitive dashboard, aiding in the evaluation of impact essential for grants programs and funding mechanisms.
