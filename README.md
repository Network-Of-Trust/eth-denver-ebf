## The problem it solves

The ecological benefits framework offers a standard way of quantifying and communicating ecological benefits for projects, but as of now there is no simple and standard way of discoverying projects and verifying their benefits.

EBFNT offers a standard way to connect attestation networks of trust to projects that claim ecological benefits, making projects discoverable, and benefits verifiable in an intuitive dashboard.

Evaluation of impact is essential for grants programs and other funding mechanisms to be able to effectively allocate capital according to verifiable impact. EBFNT allows builders, investors, and stakeholders to make informed decisions around project contributions and support.
